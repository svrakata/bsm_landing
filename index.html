                        need from the most important life science-related
                        repositories*- more than 50 mln research articles, 300 k
                        clinical trials, 2 mln grants, more than 5 mln patents —
                        a unified scientific information hub operating through a
                        semantic search algorithm. We process at one go
                        multi-component searches that are normally quite time
                        consuming.
